# Analysis of the impact of gestational diabetes (GD) on gene regulation and clinical aspects of neurodevelopment.
---
### The aim of this project was to perform a comparative analysis of miRNA expression and to relate them to aspects of neurodevelopment in order to understand the pathophysiology of the disease. The study consisted in the analysis of two groups of newborns, the first one exposed in-utero to GD and the second one was a control group. Neurodevelopmental assessment was performed between 6 and 12 months of age and the extraction of mirNAs from heel blood sample, to later perform next-generation sequencing and miRNA-Seq Analysis.
